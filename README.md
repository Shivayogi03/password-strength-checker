# password-strength-checker
A Password Strength Checker in Python evaluates the security of a password based on its length and character variety (uppercase, lowercase, digits, special characters). It classifies the password as Weak, Moderate, or Strong. The program uses regular expressions to check character types and provides suggestions to improve weak passwords.
